# Permissions

## Automation (Safari)
Ctx needs macOS Automation permission to read Safari active tab title and URL.

Expected user flow:
1. First capture attempt triggers Automation prompt.
2. User allows access for Ctx app (or Terminal for CLI mode).

## Privacy
- Data is local-only in SQLite.
- No network sync in MVP.
